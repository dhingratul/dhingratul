I am a Technical Leader specializing in Generative AI, Computer Vision, and Edge AI. With extensive experience in building and deploying AI solutions at scale, I focus on bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical applications. I specialize in solving critical problems across various domains, including Financial Technology, Autonomous Checkout, Autonomous Vehicles, and Digital Health, utilizing advanced techniques in Generative AI, Computer Vision (CV), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Edge AI. I am passionate about developing scalable, large-scale ML products.

## Key Achievements

* Spearheading safe, and secure adoption of Generative AI tools at PayPal, achieving a 30% boost in developer productivity and projected annual savings of $1M.
* Scaled Autonomous checkout systems at Standard Cognition from 2 to 40+ stores while cutting costs by $4M YoY with end to end ML Model lifecycle development. Delivered next-generation Edge AI hardware platform creating a path for cost-effective scaling to the next 100 stores, projecting margins improvement of $1M/store/year.
* Independently led the end-to-end design and selection of Edge compute for a fully autonomous (L4) platform at NIO which was foundational to Adam supercomputer powering over 100k vehicles/year.
